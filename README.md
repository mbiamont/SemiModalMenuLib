SemiModalMenuLib
================

# Why should I use this library ?
You can use this library to provide to your activities a view which, when it's visible, makes the rest of the activity not available.
You also can use this library to emphasize a part of your activities.
e.g. : 
* In your application, the user can log in. You can use this library to show the connection form.
* In your register activity, there is a Terms Of Service text that should be readable after the user has completed the form. You can use this library to show this text.
* In your activity, there is a view that isn't directly related with the rest of the activity (like an "About page"). You can use this library to show the view with fancy.

# How to use the library ?
First, add the library in your project:
* Import the project in Eclipse
* Right-click on your project > Properties > Android
* In the library part, click on the "Add" button, choose the library SemiModalMenuLib and click on "OK" button
* Click on the "Apply" button and close the dialog.

# Can I modify the library ?
Yes, of course !
The library is customisable, but, if you want to change things that cannot be customisable (for the moment), you can, it's open source. But, if you do it, please, contact me, so I can commit your change for let others developers enjoy it.
